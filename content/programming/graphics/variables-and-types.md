## Understanding Variables

Variables are named storage locations that hold data used by your program. In C++ you must declare a variable before using it, specifying its data type and optionally an initial value.

### Example

```
int age = 30;
double temperature = 98.6;
char initial = 'A';
```

The type determines how much memory is allocated and how the data is interpreted.

## Fundamental Data Types

C++ provides a range of built‑in data types including:

* `int` for integers
* `double` for floating‑point numbers
* `char` for single characters
* `bool` for boolean values

You can create more complex structures using arrays, structs and classes, which we'll cover in future articles.
