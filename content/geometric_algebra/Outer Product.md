If you take the outer product abT and subtract its transpose (swapping rows and columns), you get a skew-symmetric matrix. The elements of this matrix are exactly the components of the cross product:
abT−baT=​0−(ax​by​−ay​bx​)−(ax​bz​−az​bx​)​ax​by​−ay​bx​0−(ay​bz​−az​by​)​ax​bz​−az​bx​ay​bz​−az​by​0​​

These non-zero terms correspond to the z,y,x components of the cross product a×b.



the trace (sum of diagonal elements) of the outer product matrix is equal to the dot product of the original vectors,
