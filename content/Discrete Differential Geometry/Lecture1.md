# Overview


## Curvature
Curvature $k$ of an arc-length parametrized plane curve can be expressed as the rate fo change in the tangent. Specifically, the dot product between the normal and the rate of change of the tangent.
(Curvature is kind of a second derivative)
This definition falls apart for discrete curves. 

### Turning Angle
We can also define curvature as the rate of change of the angle the tangent makes with the horizontal. This definition plays nicer with the discrete case. 

### Steiner Formula
If we move at a constant speed in the normal direction, then the change in length is proportional to the curvature. 

### Osculating Circle
Is a circle that best approximates a curve at a point p. If we consider a circle passing through p abd two equidistant neighbors to the "left" and "right", the osculating circle is hte limiting circle as these neighbors approach p. The curvature is then the reciprocal of the radius. 

No free lunch when it comes to the definition of curvature in the discrete case.
